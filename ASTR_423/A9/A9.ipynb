OK, now imagine a white dwarf with one solar mass and the size of the Earth. Imagine it spins so fast that it makes 2 rotations per second. Calculate how fast the surface of the white dwarf is moving at its equator, in km/s. Compare this speed with the escape velocity from the surface, which you calculated earlier, and explain what would happen to your fast rotating white dwarf.\n",

Is the rotation speed at the equator larger than the escape velocity? How fast do you think this neutron star could rotate? In other words, how many rotations per second, maximum? Find in the literature what is the shortest known pulsar period, and compare with your result."
